# AI Project Overview

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Stores raw and processed datasets.
- `models/`: Stores model code and checkpoints.
- `scripts/`: Contains training, evaluation, and inference scripts.
- `results/`: Stores logs, figures, and other results.
- `config/`: Contains model and training configuration files.

## How to Run the Project
1. Place your datasets in `data/raw/`.
2. Run `train.py` to start training the model.
3. Use `evaluate.py` to test the model performance.
4. Run `inference.py` to use the trained model for predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on model framework)
- Other dependencies can be found in `requirements.txt`.

## Configuration
Modify the hyperparameters in `config/config.json` as needed before running the scripts.
